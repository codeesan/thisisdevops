# hello world!
## About
I'm a big fan of DevOps and orchestration. For years I lived in the startup world and DevOps just seemed like a way of life, or at least very easy to adopt. Most recently I've been working on evangelizing DevOps methodologies to larger enterprise companies at scale. This actually has grown on me and I've found 'my thing'.

## The Questions 
* What if enterprise didn't need evangelization? 
* What if when people started their cloud adventure, they had a place to go to look at known patterns that would save them from building a huge amount of tech debt? 
* What if you weren't going to the public cloud but needed some patterns to apply to your private cloud and/or datacenter?  
* What if you were trying to bootstrap a startup and needed some way to manage your operations on your own? 
* What if you just think DevOps is cool? 
* What if you're my mom and have no idea what I actually do? 

I'm hoping that I can answer some of these questions... mostly just for my mom.


# What Now?
I've decided to work on this backwards. I have a lot of experience in DevOps patterns and practices, I want to document and demonstrate them... but I need a project. 

Most startups have an idea and the implementation and scale come second. I'm going to do that first and decide what to build second. 

I'm also going to do this with resources that a DevOps or Cloud engineer would have access to. Hence this is github pages hosting and written in markdown. 

So, this is day 1 and I'm not 100% sure on, well, basically anything. But I'm going to try to host this site, and all the tools we develop right here in this repo. The hope is that you would have everything you need to duplicate this effort right here. I'm guessing the project (application) will need its own repo, and we're going to need some other tools like Jenkins, and some secrets management, and... well... we'll deal with that when we get to it.
